## Assignment Problem Statement

Using your AI-ML framework of your choice build, train and validate a model on the attached loan data. The model should be able to predict “Action_Taken” decisions.

Together with other data need to predict the approval/denial.

The supplied data is publicly available mortgage data where a lender has made a credit decision given a borrower’s profile and various other factors. Typical Inputs to your model could be your predictor variables. You may need to clean the data (some places NA is provided because either data is not available and/or is not applicable for the specific case.
